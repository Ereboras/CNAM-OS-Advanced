# The SHELLTAN

## Generating files

To compile, you just need to use **make** at the root of the project. Then 
For doc generation, use **make doc**.
For gcov, use **make gcov** after installing lcov.  

##Â Executing

Since we did the batch & interactive mode, you can execute commands by 2 ways :

Interactive mode :
```bash
./bin/shelltan
```

Batch mode :
```bash
./bin/shelltan -c "ls -al > toto"
```

## Known bugs

When using double redirection in one line, the result displayed will be the second command (not the third). 
However, the correct result is present in the tmp_command file.
